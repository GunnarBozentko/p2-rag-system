# Pre-registration (598E)

This file is for 598E students; it is the second half of the 598E rider, and 498E students can ignore it or delete it.

A pre-registration is a claim you write down, with the test that will judge it, before you can see the answer.
Its value is that the claim can be wrong in a way anyone can check, and that you cannot adjust it afterwards to fit the numbers.
A well-powered result that says "no effect as large as the one I cared about" scores as well as a confirmation, so you have no reason to bend the claim.

**Git history is how I will know the order.**
Commit this file, filled in through section 4, before the first commit that puts a judgment line into `eval/own/qrels.txt` (or any other file under `eval/own/`).
`uv run p2 check` reads `git log` to find the first commit in which sections 1 to 4 have no TODO marker left and some words of yours in each, and confirms that it comes before your first judgment; a copy that was filled in afterwards fails.
Right after that commit, `p2 check` names it and waits for your first judgment; it asks for section 5 separately, once you have scored your own corpus.
You may ingest your corpus and write queries first, but not the relevance judgments.
After that first commit, do not edit sections 1 to 4, because `p2 check` compares them with the commit where you filled them in.
If something must change, add a dated entry in section 6 and leave the original as it was.

You need your stage 1 scores for section 3, so score the shared corpus first.

## 1. Hypothesis

One sentence, about your own corpus, naming two of your systems and a direction.
For example: "On my corpus of Kubernetes documentation, `rerank` has a higher MRR@10 than `hybrid`, because the queries are paraphrases that a first-stage fusion ranks too low."
It should be something you could be wrong about.

On my corpus of arXiv Statistics abstracts, my hypothesis is that hybrid will outperform dense for nDCG@10 because abstracts are short and specific, so BM25 will be wrong less often and will contribute in areas where dense will miss such as matching names or acronyms.

---

## 2. The smallest effect that matters

Name one metric, MRR@10 or nDCG@10, and choose it now so you cannot pick the better one afterwards.
Then say how large a difference between the two systems would matter to a person using the search, and why that size.
A difference of 0.02 is usually not worth a reranker's cost in time and tokens.
In this course, choose a Δ of at least 0.15 unless you argue for a larger one, because a smaller gap takes more queries than one project can judge.
Call your number Δ (delta).

For the metric nDCG@10 I choose a delta of .15. A delta of .15 would be a noticeable difference between hybrid and dense as this gap would mean that the hybrid model finds the abstract in the top 10 in at least 15% more queries.

---

## 3. How many queries you need

The size of the gold set follows from three numbers: how large a difference you want to detect (Δ), how variable the per-query differences are (sd), and the usual choices of a 5% false-alarm rate and 80% power.

```
n = ((1.96 + 0.84) * sd / Δ)^2
```

Here sd is the standard deviation of the per-query differences between your two systems, which `results/results.json` holds for the shared practice queries.
Compute it from your stage 1 runs for the same two systems, or the nearest pair you have, and say which pair you used.
With only 20 practice queries the sd is itself noisy, so be generous and round up.

Some numbers to calibrate against.
At sd 0.3 and Δ 0.10 the formula gives about 71 queries, and with the t distribution's small-sample correction it is a few more, about 73.
At sd 0.3, a gold set of 30 queries can only detect a difference of about 0.15, which is why 30 queries cannot support a claim about a gap of 0.10.
The spreads you will measure on the shared practice queries are mostly larger than 0.3: from about 0.31 for `hybrid` against `bm25` to about 0.66 for `dense` against `bm25`.
For `rerank` against `hybrid` the sd is about 0.39, so a Δ of 0.10 needs about 120 queries, 0.15 about 55, and 0.20 about 31.
So the course's Δ of 0.15 means about 55 queries for that pair; at an sd of 0.66 it would mean about 150, so compare a pair whose spread you can afford.
Choose Δ and the size of your gold set together: the smallest effect that matters to a user, and a number of queries you can write and judge in the time you have.
If the two do not meet, say which one you gave ground on and why.

After you score the own corpus, the minimum detectable difference that `uv run p2 score` prints for your two systems is this same calculation run the other way.
It should come out at or below your Δ.
If it does not, your queries varied more than your stage 1 sd suggested, and you will say so in the outcome.

My standard deviation is .383 and it comes from the hybrid minus dense pair for the nDCG@10 metric from results/results.json on the 20 practice queries. 

n = ((1.96 + 0.84) * 0.383 / .15)^2 = 51.11

My n is 51.11, but I will write 55 queries just in case the standard deviation of my own corpus for hybrid vs dense for nDCG@10 is a bit higher.

---

## 4. The test, and what each result will mean

The test is the paired 95% interval of the mean difference between your two systems on your own gold set, from the `own-pairs` table that `uv run p2 score` writes in `EVAL.md`.
Write the rule now.
This is the default rule, and you can tighten it, but do not loosen it after you see your numbers.

| The interval is | I will say |
|---|---|
| entirely above zero in the direction I predicted | supported: the difference is distinguishable from zero |
| entirely on the other side of zero | contradicted: the opposite of my hypothesis holds on this gold set |
| around zero, with both ends inside plus or minus Δ | well-powered null: a difference as large as Δ is ruled out |
| around zero, with an end beyond plus or minus Δ | inconclusive: the gold set could not settle it, and I say so |

I confirm this table of rules/conclusions. I am testing the mean difference of hybrid minus dense for the metric nDCG@10 with a delta of .15.

## 5. Outcome (write this after the fact)

What was the interval?
Which row of the table in section 4 is it?
Did your gold set reach the size section 3 asked for, and what was the minimum detectable difference that `uv run p2 score` printed?
What would you do next, and what would you want a reader to take from this?

The interval was hybrid minus dense on nDCG@10. The mean was -0.060, the 95% interval was [-0.127, 0.001], and this comes from the own-pairs table and results/results.json.

In the section 4 table, it is row 3, the well-powered null. The interval includes zero and both ends are inside +- 0.15. A difference as large as delta is ruled out in either direction and the point estimate leans toward dense. This is against my hypothesis, but it is not distinguishable from zero. 

The gold set did reach its size as I had 55 queries, and the target n was 51.11. The MDD was 0.093, which is below the delta of 0.15. The reason my MDD was much lower than the targeted 0.15 was because my corpus's sd was 0.247 against the 0.383 of the shared corpus's sd. 

What I would do next would be to weigh my hybrid model differently. Currently it is weighted 50% BM25 and 50% dense. I would weigh it more heavily towards dense (around 70%). This would help hybrid perform better on the paraphrase queries where a confidently wrong BM25 list can outvote a correct dense answer. What I would want for a reader to take away from this is that adding bm25 to dense on my abstracts, with equal-weight RRF for a hybrid model has no measurable gain over a standard dense model.
